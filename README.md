# Daily Question - JavaScript Conditionals/Equality

Assume you need to test the value of the following variable in JavaScript:
```
var length = "75";
```
A block of code must execute if the length equals 75 regardless of the data type.
You need to identify the *statement or statements* that meet/s the requirement.

Which line of code could you use? (HINT: Multiple answers below *may* be correct so pick all that apply and note your answer(s) clearly at the bottom of this README)

A. ```if (length === 75) { // Some block of code to execute }``` MY ANSWER IS A.

B. ```if (length == 75) { // Some block of code to execute }``` THIS COULD ALSO BE CORRECT I BELIEVE.

C. ```if (length! = 75) { // Some block of code to execute }```THIS CHECKS IF IT'S NOT EQUAL

D. ```if (length == "75") { // Some block of code to execute }```DON'T THINK THE QOUTES ARE NEEDED?
